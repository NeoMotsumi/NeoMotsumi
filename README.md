ðŸš€ Cloud Architect | Platform Engineer | Blockchain Enthusiast ðŸš€

Passionate about building scalable, resilient, and secure cloud-native solutions. With a deep understanding of Kubernetes, cloud orchestration, and platform engineering, I am committed to streamlining infrastructure and application delivery.

I am proficient in leveraging tools like Crossplane, Melange, and apko to automate infrastructure provisioning and application packaging. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the potential of Hyperledger Fabric to build robust and decentralized applications.

Apart from my job as a platform engineer, I have been working on projects for [Nimbostack](https://github.com/Nimbostack), my current focus being primarily on creating cloud-native blockchain solutions, including creating secure container images using declarative pipelines.
